## Task
Predicting Loan Conversion rate for Galaxy bank using machine learning techniques

## Description
This project is aimed at improving the marketing conversion rates of Galaxy Bank, a financial institution that wants to upsell its deposit customers to become personal loan customers. The objective is to increase the loan acceptance conversion rate by using data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict which customers are most likely to accept a loan offer from the bank. The project will involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The results will be presented to the marketing leadership of the bank, and the project's success criteria will be measured based on the improvement of the loan acceptance conversion rate.

## Installation
During this project, I made use of some data science like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn.
To install these libraries, you need to use the 'pip install' command in python for Installation

## Usage
To use this predictive model, the data needs to be clean before feeding it to the predictive model for prediction
